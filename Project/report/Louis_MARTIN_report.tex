%% Abstract (Â½ page):
%% What problem(s) is studied ?
This paper will focus on how to efficiently learn a dictionary in order to obtain a sparse representation of a signal (e.g. image or audio).
%% Why is it relevant ?
Deriving a sparse representation of a signal can be very efficient in solving multiple signal processing problems.
It has been successfully used in compression, inpainting, denoising, inverse problems and more.
One way to obtain a sparse coding is by using dictionaries.
A dictionary acts as a basis on which the data can be accurately represented using a small number of coefficients.
This basis can be either predefined or learned, both approaches have shown great results.
We will here focus how to efficiently learn an appropriate dictionary given the data we want to encode.
Finding a good dictionary is indeed important because it will define the representational power of the sparse coding,
i.e. how well the sparse coded signal will represent the original signal.
The learning process is therefore a key step for sparse representation.
%% What solution(s) is proposed ?
We propose to study and compare three different approaches to dictionary learning.
K-SVD algorithm which is proposed as a generalization of clustering algorithms such as k-means.
Online matrix factorization which provides an online approach to dictionary learning for big datasets.
An intuitive block coordinate projected gradient descent which is a specific case of the forward-backward proximal iterave method.

\section{Introduction}
%% Introduction (~3 pages) :
%% Presentation of the problem(s).
Sparse coding is able to solve multiple signal processing tasks such as compression \cite{marcellin00}, inpainting, denoising \cite{elad06}, texture synthesis \cite{peyre09} and so on.
% Why do we want sparsity, i.e. a small number of non-zero coefficients ?
% 1) Compression
Sparsity, i.e. having a small number of non-zero coefficients, is wanted for several of its useful properties.

It is very effective for compression for obvious reasons of storage space, we only have to store a small set of sparse coefficients that will permit an accurate reconstruction if the original signal.
% 2) Theorem in the first lecture -> good compression coefficients => good denoising

Good compression coefficients also often implies good denoising properties.
Noise is indeed often small local high frequency and unstructured information that is pruned by the sparse coding.
% 3) Natural images tend to have a small number of non-zero coefficients.
% Complex images like random images (or lot of noise) or trees will have a higher number of coefficient.
Natural image tend to have a small number of non-zero coefficient whereas complex images like random images or images with trees will have a higher number of coefficients.
% Sparsity is the a good indicator of natural images
Sparsity is therefore a good indicator of natural images.

Given that having a sparse representation is useful, we want to pay particular attention to the choice of the space in which this representation lives.
The problem is often translated to finding a good basis for this space.
This basis of interest can either be predefined or learned.

One can use a predefined basis which will be fixed for all tasks and datasets such as the Fourier basis or the wavelet basis thanks to \cite{mallat99}.
The fact that such a basis does not depend on the data makes it hard to design but also powerful because it is universal can be reused and define a standard.
For example a good sparse representation of natural images in the wavelet space led to the success of the JPEG2000 algorithm for image compression, see \cite{marcellin00}.

Another approach is to learn the basis, which is what we will focus on in this paper.
From this point on we will interpret this basis as a dictionary for reasons that we will explain later.
A dictionary is a set of representative signals called atoms.
The signal of interest is therefore expressed as a linear combination of these atoms.

Having a learned dictionary that is specific to a certain type of data or to one image in particular can be very powerful.
The sparse representation can at the same time be sparser and represent the data better.
Another key idea is to design overcomplete dictionaries which means that there are more atoms than the each atom dimension and so these atoms are not linearly independent.
This is why the term basis to denote an overcomplete dictionary is abusive.
Designing overcomplete dicionaries gives more flexibility to the sparse representation and leads to easier problems than with an complete basis.
However with atoms that are non linearly independant, the decomposition is not unique as it would be with orthogonal basis such as Fourier or wavelet which makes the problem harder to solve analytically.
This is why we will study iterative approaches.

\section{Problem statement}
\subsection{Notations}
Given a signal of size $m$, \textbf{$y \in \RR^m$}, a dictionary is a collection of $k$ prototype signal atoms represented in a matrix $D \in \RR^{m \times p}$
We want to find $x \in \RR^p$, the sparse representation of $y$ in the dictionary $D$.
An representation $D x = y$ being often hard to find we will settle with an approximate representation $ D x \approx y$.
A sparse vector is a vector with a "small" number of non-zero coefficient, this is why the sparsity measure is the $l_0$ pseudo-norm denoted $\norm{.}_0$ which counts the number of non-zero coefficients.
The sparsity constraint then writes $\norm{x}_0<k$ with $k \in \mathbbm{N}$.

The problem we want to solve is therefore
$$\min\limits_{D \in \RR^{m \times p}, x \in \RR^p} \norm{y - Dx}_2^2  \text{  subject to  } \norm{x}_0<k$$


The sparsity measure, the $l_0$ pseudo-norm is non-convex which makes the problem hard to solve in many approaches like gradient descent because we are not guaranteed to find a minimum.
Given that $\forall p <1$, the $l_p$ pseudo-norm is non convex, the closest convex norm that we can use is the $l_1$ norm which is in practice a good measure of the sparsity of a signal compared to other norms.
This norm favors sparse representation as can be seen in figure \ref{l1l2_norm}.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
\centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{l1l2_norm.jpg}
  \caption{The $l_1$ norm favors sparisty}
  \label{l1l2_norm}
\end{figure}

The constraint on $x$ will be represented by $x \in \chi_k = \{ x \in \RR^{p \times n}, \norm{x}_0<k \}$.
Furthermore we will want the dictionary to have normalized atoms.
Otherwise the atoms norm will increase for the sole purpose of decreasing the sparse representation norm and hence the $l_1$ constraint.
To prevent this behaviour from occuring we  will want $ D \in \mathcal{D} $ with $\mathcal{D} = \{ D \in \RR^{m \times p}, \forall i=1 \ldots p, \norm{D_{\cdot,i}} \leq 1 \}$.

We will often want to minimize the error over $n$ signals which will give us the problem :
$$\min\limits_{D \in \mathcal{D}, (x_i)_{i=1}^n \in \chi_k} \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \norm{y_i - Dx_i}_2^2$$
with $Y \in \RR^{m \times n}, Y = [y_1 \ldots y_n]$ and $X \in \RR^{p \times n}, X = [x_1 \ldots x_n]$.

The problem now rewrites in matrix form:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:1}
\min\limits_{D \in \mathcal{D}, X \in \chi_k} E(X,D) = \min\limits_{D \in \mathcal{D}, X \in \chi_k} \norm{Y - DX}_F^2
\end{equation}

Other methods like proximal methods will prefer rewriting \label{eq:1} as:
$$\min_{X, D} E(X,D) + \iota_{\chi_k}(X) + \iota_{\mathcal{D}}(D)$$
with $\iota_C$ the indicator of set $C$ defined by
$ \iota_C(x) =
\begin{cases}
0, & \text{if } x \in C\\
+ \infty, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$

\subsection{Splitting the dictionary learning task into two subproblems}
Minimizing \ref{eq:1} both over $D$ and $X$ jointly is often not feasible.
That is why many approach split it into two subproblems that can be solved iteratively.
The first is to sparse code the data given the dictionary and the second to update the dictionary given this sparse coding. Fixing a variable and minimizing over the other was studied to work well in practice by \cite{lee06}.

\subsubsection{Finding the sparse representation}
This subproblem writes:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:2}
X \in \argmin_{X \in \chi_k} \norm{Y - DX}^2
\end{equation}
Equation \ref{eq:2} is typically solved by iterating over X until we have a solution that yields a small enough error $E(X,D)$.
Several alorithms called "pursuit algorithms" use this approach.

The most intuitive is matching pursuit which was introduced by \cite{mallat93} and successfully applied to signal decomposition.
The algorithm finds for each signal $y$, the atom $d_i$ which captures the most energy in the sense that
$$d_i = \argmax_{d_i \in D} |<y, d_i>|$$.
The corresponding coefficient is then set to $$x_i = \frac{<y, d_i>}{\norm{d_i}^2}$$ and the captured information is removed from $y$ so that $$y \leftarrow y - x_i d_i$$.
This process then is repeated until we reach the wanted sparsity or until the error is below a specified threshold.
A popular extension is orthogonal matching pursuit which updates all coefficients at each iteration.
Other pursuit algorithm are based on the matching pursuit approach and have shown great results such as FOCUSS for example.
% TODO: (mairal10a)
A number of recent methods for solving this type of problems are based on coordinate
descent with soft thresholding (Fu, 1998; Friedman et al., 2007; Wu and Lange, 2008).

MP OMP FOCUSS \cite{gorodnitsky97} PGD
Wikipedia -> A popular extension of Matching Pursuit (MP) is its orthogonal version: Orthogonal Matching Pursuit[11][12] (OMP). The main difference from MP is that after every step, all the coefficients extracted so far are updated, by computing the orthogonal projection of the signal onto the set of atoms selected so far. This can lead to better results than standard MP, but requires more computation.
\subsubsection{Finding the dictionary}

Finding the best sparse representation of a signal is a NP-Hard problem, that is why we will approximate the signal.

\section{Dictionary learning methods}

%% Numerics.
Most of the iterative methods are composed of the two steps defined above.
Sparse coding the vector and updating the dictionary given this sparse representation.


\subsection{Proximal methods}
% TODO:
\cite{olshausen97} (k-SVD p-4313 [24])
% TODO:
In the case of dictionary learning, the classical projected first-order projected stochastic gradient
descent algorithm (as used by Aharon and Elad 2008; Kavukcuoglu et al. 2008 for instance) consists
of a sequence of updates of D:



A intuitive and efficient algorithm for dictionary learning is to use a block coordinate gradient descent approach as in implemented in \cite{nt4} and is shown to converge in \cite{tseng01}.
This algorithm is part of the category of proximal methods and has gained substantial attention in signal processing \cite{combettes11}.
This is a two step algorithm.
We initialize $n$ training signals $(y_i \in \RR^m)_{i=1}^{n}$
that we put in a matrix $Y \in \RR^{m \times n}, Y = [y_1 \ldots y_n]$.
\begin{itemize}
  \item First we find the best sparse representation of the data given a fixed dictionary.
  	\begin{equation} \label{eq:pgd1}
      X^{(i+1)} \in \argmin_{X \in \chi_k} \norm{Y - D^{(i)}X}^2
	\end{equation}
  \item Then we update the dictionary given this sparse representation.
  	\begin{equation} \label{eq:pgd2}
      D^{(i+1)} \in \argmin_{D \in \mathcal{D}} \norm{Y - DX^{(i+1)}}^2
	\end{equation}
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection*{Forward-Backward algorithm}
\ref{eq:pgd1} and \ref{eq:pgd2} can be solved using the Forward-Backward proximal algorithm which is detailed in \cite{combettes11}, \cite{parikh14} and in the class lectures.
We have
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
x^* \in \argmin_x F(x) + G(x) & \Longleftrightarrow 0 \in \nabla F(x^*) + \partial G(x^*)\\
							  & \Longleftrightarrow (x^* - \gamma \nabla F(x^*)) \in x^* + \gamma \partial G(x^*)\\
                              & \Longleftrightarrow x^* = Prox_{\gamma G} (x^* - \gamma \nabla F(x^*))
\end{split}
\end{equation*}

The Forward-Backward update thus reads
$$x^{(i+1)} = Prox_{\gamma G} (x^{(i)} - \gamma \nabla F(x^{(i)})$$
with the proximal operator being an natural extension of the projection on a convex set.
$$Prox_{\gamma G}(x) = \argmin_z \frac{1}{2} \norm{x - z}^2 + \gamma G(z)$$

When $G = \iota_C$ then the proximal operator is the projection on the convex set C.
$$Prox_{\gamma G}(x) = \argmin_{z \in C} \norm{x - z} = \Pi_C(x)$$
In this special case, Forward-Back is equivalent to \emph{projected gradient descent}


\subsubsection*{Back to dictionary learning}
\ref{eq:pgd1} and \ref{eq:pgd2} can be rewritten as
$$\argmin_X E(X,D) + \iota_{\chi_k}$$
$$\argmin_D E(X,D) + \iota_{\mathcal{D}}$$

We thus only need compute the gradient of $E(X,D)$ with respect to X and D and apply the Forward-Backward update rule to finally have:

$$ X^{(i+1)} = X^{(i)} - \gamma D^T (D^{(i)}X^{(i)} - Y) $$
$$ D^{(i+1)} = D^{(i)} - \tau (D^{(i)}X^{(i+1)} - Y) X^T $$

\subsection{K-SVD}
The approach in \cite{aharon06} is interesting in the way that it considers the dictionary learning problem as a generalization of a clustering problem. Clustering is indeed an extreme case of sparse coding where there is only one non-zero coefficient and this coefficient must be one.

The K-SVD algorithm can be used with any sparse coding technique because it is focused on the dictionary update.
Each column $d_k$ of the dictionary is updated independently takes to a good decomposition of the error $E(X,D)$ into a matrix that does not depend on $d_k$ and a rank 1 matrix that does.
\begin{equation} \label{eq:ksvd1}
\begin{split}
  E(X,D) & = \norm{Y - DX}_F^2 \\
  		 & = \norm{Y - \sum\limits_{j=1}^{p} d_j x^j} \text{ ($x^j$ is the $j$th row, not the column $x_j$)}\\
         & = \norm{(Y - \sum\limits_{j \neq k} d_j x^j)  - d_k x^k}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

We will then subset these matrices to only keep the parts that use the column $d_k$.
That is why the ensemble $\omega_k = \{i | i = 1 \ldots N, x^k(i) \neq 0\}$, is introduced. It denotes the indices of the samples that use the atom $d_k$.
Using this ensemble we can construct the matrix $\Omega_k \in N \times |\omega_k|$ with ones at the $(\omega_k(i),i)$ coordinates and zeros everywhere else.

This matrix will subset the problem to only the values concerned by the update of the column $d_k$.

We can now rewrite the minimization of the error defined in \ref{eq:ksvd1} as
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
  \min_{d_k \in \mathcal{D}, x^k \in \chi_k} \norm{E_k - d_k x^k }_F^2 & = \min_{d_k \in \mathcal{D}, x^k \in \chi_k} \norm{E_k \Omega_k - d_k x^k \Omega_k}_F^2 \\
  											& = \min_{d_k \in \mathcal{D}, x^k_R} \norm{E_k^R - d_k x^k_R}_F^2 \\
                                            & \text{ (with $E_k^R$ and $x^k_R$ only values concerned by $d_k$)}
\end{split}
\end{equation*}

Note that we optimize on both $d_k$ and $x^k_R$ at the same time. The restriction of $x^k$ to $x^k_R$ also forces it to have the same support before and after the update so that we don't need to explicitely enforce the sparsity constraint.
This basically boils down to finding the best rank one matrix approximation of $E_k^R$.
With $E_k^R = U \Delta V^T$ being the SVD decomposition of $E_k^R$, EckartâYoungâMirsky theorem states that $\sigma_1 u_1 v_1^T$ is the best rank one approximation of $E_k^R$.\\
The update rule is therefore $d_k \leftarrow u_1$ and $x^k_R \leftarrow \sigma_1 v_1$.
This step is repeated for all the columns as it is done for the means in K-means thus the name K-SVD.


\subsection{Online learning for matrix factorization}
\cite{mairal10}
\ref{eq:1} can be interpreted as a matrix factorization problem. Indeed we try to find a factorization of $Y$ in the form $DX$.
When confronted with a very large number of samples $N$, it is impractical to work directly with the $Y$ and $X$ matrices. That is why this paper proposes to solve the problem iteratively, sample by sample in an online fashion. Online learning also reduces overfitting if given a big enough dataset.

The method proposed draws random samples as in stochastic gradient descent, derive its sparse representation and then updates the dictionary.
However the objective is to not only update the dictionary based on the current sample but also on all the samples that we previously considered in order to have a more substantial update.
The sparse coding step is done using the $l_1$ penalty with LARS-lasso algorithm from \cite{efron04}.

Let's rewrite the update rule in a form that will lead to an efficient algorithm.
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
  D_t & = \argmin_{D \in \mathcal{D}} \frac{1}{t} \sum\limits_{i=1}^t (\frac{1}{2} \norm{y_i - D x_i}_2^2 + \lambda \norm{x_i}_1)\\
      & = \argmin_{D \in \mathcal{D}} \frac{1}{t}  (\frac{1}{2} \norm{Y_t - DX_t}_F^2 + \lambda \norm{X_t}_{1,1})\\
      & = \argmin_{D \in \mathcal{D}} \frac{1}{t}  (\frac{1}{2} \norm{Y_t - DX_t}_F^2) \text{   ($\norm{X_t}_{1,1}$ does not depend on $D$)}\\
      & = \argmin_{D \in \mathcal{D}} \frac{1}{t}  (\frac{1}{2} Tr((Y_t - DX_t)^T (Y_t - DX_t)))\\
      & = \argmin_{D \in \mathcal{D}} \frac{1}{t}  (\frac{1}{2} Tr(Y_t Y_t^T) - Tr(X_t^T D^T Y_t) + \frac{1}{2} Tr(X_t^T D^T D X_t))\\
      & = \argmin_{D \in \mathcal{D}} \frac{1}{t}  (\frac{1}{2} Tr(D^T D X_t X_t^T) - Tr(D^T Y_t X_t^T) )\\
      & = \argmin_{D \in \mathcal{D}} \frac{1}{t}  (\frac{1}{2} Tr(D^T D A_t) - Tr(D^T B_t) )
\end{split}
\end{equation*}

We can decompose $A_t$ and $B_t$ as follows:
$$ A_t = \sum\limits_{i=1}^t x_i x_i^T \text{ and } B_t = \sum\limits_{i=1}^t y_i x_i^T $$
We can therefore update $A_t$ and $B_t$ for each sample and not compute them from scratch every time.

We can then update each column independently with:
$$ u_j \leftarrow \frac{1}{A[j,j](b_j - D a_j) + d_j} $$
$$ d_j \leftarrow \frac{1}{\max(\norm{u_j}_2, 1)} u_j $$

% TODO:
This algorithm is shown to converge to a solution $D^*$ and note that it does not depend on any paramater such as a learning rate.
