\section{Introduction}
% Introduction (~3 pages) : 
% Presentation of the problem(s). 
% Previous works (at least a few citations). If relevant, include things that you have seen during the MVA course (or possibly other courses). 
% Contributions. Why is the studied method different/better/worse/etc. than existing previous works. 

Decomposing a vector on a sparse basis is good because of: 
% Why do we want sparsity, i.e. a small number of non-zero coefficients ?
% 1) Compression
% 2) Theorem in the first lecture -> good compression coefficients => good denoising
% 3) Natural images tend to have a small number of non-zero coefficients.
% Complex images like random images (or lot of noise) or trees will have a higher number of coefficient.
% Sparsity is the a good indicator of natural images
% TODO: citation with author and date
The choice of the basis is important.
One can use a predefined basis which will be the same for all tasks and datasets as the Fourier basis or the wavelet basis \cite{mallat1999}.
% TODO: talking of 'basis' is abusive because it is often overcomplete
Another approach is to learn the basis, i.e. to learn a dictionary which gives good results in several tasks has 
%%%%%%%%%% Taken from \cite{matrixfactorization}
recently led to state-of-the-art
results in numerous low-level signal processing tasks such as image denoising (Elad and Aharon,
2006; Mairal et al., 2008b), texture synthesis (Peyre, 2009) and audio processing (Grosse et al., ´
2007; Fevotte et al., 2009; Zibulevsky and Pearlmutter, 2001), as well as higher- ´ level tasks such as
image classification (Raina et al., 2007; Mairal et al., 2008a, 2009b; Bradley and Bagnell, 2009;
Yang et al., 2009),
%%%%%%%%%%
The basis is not orthogonal -> more flexibility
The learnt basis look like wavelets / Gabor filters but are tuned to the data -> better accuracy

\section{MAIN BODY}
% Main body (~10 pages) : 
% Presentation of the method(s). 
% Theoretical guarantees. 
% Numerics. 

\section{Conclusion}
% Conclusion and perspective (~1 page)
% Summary of the result obtained: pros and cons (limitation, problems, error in the articles, etc)
% Possible improvement/extension
First filters of neural networks -> looks like a dictionary

% Information for the project report: 
% If possible, write the report in english. 
% You must bring a printed version with your to give me before the presentation. This is a strict deadline. 
% Using Latex is highly recommended.
% Roughly 15 pages (A4, 11pt font, single column), including roughly one page of bibliography.
% Should be similar to a (short) scientific article in an applied mathematics journal. 
% No source code. 
% When presenting the numerics, give all parameters, so that the results are reproducible. 
% It should not be a rewriting of the original article. You should only report about what you have done, and only explain the theory that is relevant to explain the numerics you have done.
% Suggestion of structure for the report:

% What problem(s) is studied ? 
% Why is it relevant ? 
% What solution(s) is proposed ? 
% Which contributions (theory, numerics, etc) ?

% Very useful to have a redundant dictionary i.e. more words than each word dimension.
% 
 
% En gros implementer ce qu'ils disent dans les papiers.
% Jouer avec les parametres et essayer de voir ce qui marche bien.
% Parametres:
% taille des patch
% choix du seuil
% param de moyennage (param magique)
% 
% Appliquer ça à l'inpainting:
% faire le dictionnary learning direct sur l'image avec des trous. Ca marche mieux
% que de le faire sur une image sans trous.
