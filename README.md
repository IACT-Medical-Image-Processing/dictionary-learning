# Dictionary learning
This is my final project of the MVA course "Sparsity and Compressed Sensing" from Gabriel Peyr√©.

The goal is to learn a dictionary from a set of signals so that each signal has a sparse representation on this dictionary, i.e. is a linear combination of a small number of elements of the dictionary.

The algorithm studied are K-SVD, Online Matrix Factorization and the Forward-Backward proximal iterative scheme.
